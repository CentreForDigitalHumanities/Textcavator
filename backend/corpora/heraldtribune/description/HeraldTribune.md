The International Herald Tribune Archive (1887–2013) includes every published issue of the French, English-language newspaper. It started as the *Paris Herald*, a Paris edition of *The New York Herald*. In 1924, it changed name to *The new York Herald Tribune*, and finally *The International Herald Tribune* by 1967.
The current *The International New York Times*, established in 2013, is not covered by this archive.
