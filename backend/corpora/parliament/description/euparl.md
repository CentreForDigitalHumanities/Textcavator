## Notes

### Language and translations

Speakers in the European Parliament use a large number of different languages. The documents in the this corpus include both the original speech, and an English translation.

Translations are taken from the source datasets (see above). Translations in the EUPDCorp dataset are machine-translated.

### Parties

The _party_ field specifies the political group of the speaker in the European Parliament. In addition, the _national party_ field specifies the speaker's party at the national level.

Because the data is extracted from multiple datasets, the corpus may use a different name for the same political group before and after 2024.
