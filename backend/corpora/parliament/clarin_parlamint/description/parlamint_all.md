# ParlaMint: Comparable and Interoperable Parliamentary Corpora
The CLARIN ERIC flagship project ParlaMint enables transnational and multidisciplinary analyses of parliamentary debates across 29 countries and autonomous regions in Europe. 

Overcoming the obstacles of multilinguality and diversity of data formats, the project created interoperable and comparable corpora that facilitate transnational comparisons and enhance the understanding of parliamentary discourse and its societal impact locally and globally. 

The corpora are available in open access and are a valuable source of information for researchers in a broad range of SSH disciplines, such as political and social sciences, media and communication studies, history and language studies, and are also relevant to policy makers.

The ParlaMint project is now being further developed in the OSCARS project [ParlaCAP](https://clarinsi.github.io/parlacap/), which will provide a robust dataset for tracking political agenda-setting across European parliaments.
